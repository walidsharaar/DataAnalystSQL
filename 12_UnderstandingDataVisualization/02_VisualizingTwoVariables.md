## Scatter plots | Theory
- Scatter plots are essential for visualizing the relationship between two continuous variables, offering insights into correlations and trends.

### Facts
- Scatter plots are used to explore the relationship between two continuous variables.
- Los Angeles County home price dataset includes bedrooms, sale prices, and square footage.
- Logarithmic scales in scatter plots help evenly distribute data points for better readability.
- Correlation in scatter plots indicates the strength and direction of relationships between variables.
- Sometimes, complex data shapes may not align with traditional correlation interpretations.
- Adding trend lines (straight or smooth curves) aids in understanding relationships between variables in scatter plots.

## Line plots | Theory
- Line plots are useful when depicting data points sequentially over time, particularly when analyzing trends or comparisons over a continuous sequence. However, consecutive data points must be conceptually connected for effective representation.

### Facts
- A close relative to the scatter plot is the line plot.
- Line plots are preferable when representing the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases worldwide over time, offering a clearer understanding than scatter plots.
- Use line plots when consecutive data points are connected, typically on an x-axis representing dates or times.
- Line plots enable comparisons between multiple lines on the same plot, facilitating analysis of trends across different categories
- Comparing line plots to trend lines derived from linear regression helps to understand the growth patterns within specific datasets.
- Transforming line plots to a logarithmic scale on the y-axis reveals exponential growth patterns in datasets.
- Not all datasets with a time-based x-axis necessitate line plots; a scatter plot might be more appropriate if individual data points are not sequentially connected.
- Line plots may not always be effective; for instance, a plot of juvenile offenders in Switzerland with an age group representation lacked clarity in conveying insights without a time x-axis.

## Bar plots | Theory
- Bar plots are useful for visualizing counts or percentages of categorical variables, emphasizing the importance of zero in the data representation.

### Facts
- Bar plots are similar to box plots, focusing on categorical variables.
- They're ideal for displaying counts or percentages where zero holds significance.
- Bros, a pop band in 1988, pondered "When will I be famous?" â€” data science might have an answer.
- ESPN's 2017 list of most famous athletes was based on social media following, endorsements, and search popularity.
- Bar plot illustrating athlete counts by country from the ESPN dataset.
- Swapping axes in bar plots affects readability; horizontal bars are preferable.
- Sorting bars by count aids comparison between categories.
- Dataset on children's fruit and veg consumption from England's Health Survey in 2018.
- Stacking bars illustrates changing percentages over time in children's dietary habits.
- Comparison between bar plots (counts) and box plots (spread of variables).
- Bar plots can represent other metrics beyond counts, like mean age in a less dynamic manner than box plots.

## Dot plots | Theory
- Dot plots are a versatile alternative to bar plots, offering advantages like logarithmic scale usage and the ability to represent multiple metrics.

### Facts
- Dot plots, akin to bar plots, suit similar scenarios but offer the advantages of logarithmic scale compatibility and accommodating multiple metric representations.
- A dataset illustrating nearby stars' distance from Earth in light years and their mass in solar masses is showcased.
- When comparing bar plots and dot plots for star masses, the limitations of bar plots on a logarithmic scale become apparent, necessitating the use of dot plots to visualize accurately.
- Logarithmic scales aid in understanding weight comparisons between stars.
- Row sorting is crucial in dot plots, much like bar plots, facilitating easier analysis of the heaviest or lightest stars nearest to Earth.

## Higher dimensions | Theory
- Understanding higher dimensions beyond the typical two in visualizations involves various techniques like color, size, transparency, shape, and multiple panels, each with its pros and cons.

### Facts
- Visualizing Beyond 2D: Exploring more than two variables in visualizations raises challenges.
- UN Scatter Plots: Life expectancy plotted against schooling length and GNI separately; exploring their combined effect.
- 3D Scatter Plots: Despite being an option, 3D scatter plots lose perspective on a 2D screen, complicating interpretation.
- Beyond x and y: Techniques like color, size, transparency, and shape aid in representing multiple dimensions.
- Color Representation: Color signifies life expectancy, displaying correlations but lacks precise values.
- Size Variation: Points' size represents data, but it can create overlapping issues and visual dominance.
- Transparency Impact: Similar to size, transparency affects focus and precision in data interpretation.
- Shape Differentiation: Using shapes for age ranges in life expectancy, though not ideal due to mental burden.
- Multiple Panels: Dividing data into panels reveals trends across subsets but can complicate interpretation.
- More Panel Precision: Smaller panels offer more precision but also increase visual complexity.
- Line Plot Dimensions: Line plots incorporate aesthetics like color, thickness, transparency, and linetype.
- Color in Line Plots: Color distinguishes lines in technology adoption plots effectively.
- Linetype Usage: Linetype as an alternative dimension in line plots, albeit challenging for distinction.
