## Scatter plots | Theory
- Scatter plots are essential for visualizing the relationship between two continuous variables, offering insights into correlations and trends.

### Facts
- Scatter plots are used to explore the relationship between two continuous variables.
- Los Angeles County home price dataset includes bedrooms, sale prices, and square footage.
- Logarithmic scales in scatter plots help evenly distribute data points for better readability.
- Correlation in scatter plots indicates the strength and direction of relationships between variables.
- Sometimes, complex data shapes may not align with traditional correlation interpretations.
- Adding trend lines (straight or smooth curves) aids in understanding relationships between variables in scatter plots.

## Line plots | Theory
- Line plots are useful when depicting data points sequentially over time, particularly when analyzing trends or comparisons over a continuous sequence. However, consecutive data points must be conceptually connected for effective representation.

### Facts
- A close relative to the scatter plot is the line plot.
- Line plots are preferable when representing the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases worldwide over time, offering a clearer understanding than scatter plots.
- Use line plots when consecutive data points are connected, typically on an x-axis representing dates or times.
- Line plots enable comparisons between multiple lines on the same plot, facilitating analysis of trends across different categories
- Comparing line plots to trend lines derived from linear regression helps to understand the growth patterns within specific datasets.
- Transforming line plots to a logarithmic scale on the y-axis reveals exponential growth patterns in datasets.
- Not all datasets with a time-based x-axis necessitate line plots; a scatter plot might be more appropriate if individual data points are not sequentially connected.
- Line plots may not always be effective; for instance, a plot of juvenile offenders in Switzerland with an age group representation lacked clarity in conveying insights without a time x-axis.

## Bar plots | Theory
- Bar plots are useful for visualizing counts or percentages of categorical variables, emphasizing the importance of zero in the data representation.

### Facts
- Bar plots are similar to box plots, focusing on categorical variables.
- They're ideal for displaying counts or percentages where zero holds significance.
- Bros, a pop band in 1988, pondered "When will I be famous?" â€” data science might have an answer.
- ESPN's 2017 list of most famous athletes was based on social media following, endorsements, and search popularity.
- Bar plot illustrating athlete counts by country from the ESPN dataset.
- Swapping axes in bar plots affects readability; horizontal bars are preferable.
- Sorting bars by count aids comparison between categories.
- Dataset on children's fruit and veg consumption from England's Health Survey in 2018.
- Stacking bars illustrates changing percentages over time in children's dietary habits.
- Comparison between bar plots (counts) and box plots (spread of variables).
- Bar plots can represent other metrics beyond counts, like mean age in a less dynamic manner than box plots.
