## Higher dimensions | Theory
- Understanding higher dimensions beyond the typical two in visualizations involves various techniques like color, size, transparency, shape, and multiple panels, each with its pros and cons.

### Facts
- Visualizing Beyond 2D: Exploring more than two variables in visualizations raises challenges.
- UN Scatter Plots: Life expectancy plotted against schooling length and GNI separately; exploring their combined effect.
- 3D Scatter Plots: Despite being an option, 3D scatter plots lose perspective on a 2D screen, complicating interpretation.
- Beyond x and y: Techniques like color, size, transparency, and shape aid in representing multiple dimensions.
- Color Representation: Color signifies life expectancy, displaying correlations but lacks precise values.
- Size Variation: Points' size represents data, but it can create overlapping issues and visual dominance.
- Transparency Impact: Similar to size, transparency affects focus and precision in data interpretation.
- Shape Differentiation: Using shapes for age ranges in life expectancy, though not ideal due to mental burden.
- Multiple Panels: Dividing data into panels reveals trends across subsets but can complicate interpretation.
- More Panel Precision: Smaller panels offer more precision but also increase visual complexity.
- Line Plot Dimensions: Line plots incorporate aesthetics like color, thickness, transparency, and linetype.
- Color in Line Plots: Color distinguishes lines in technology adoption plots effectively.
- Linetype Usage: Linetype as an alternative dimension in line plots, albeit challenging for distinction.

## Using color | Theory
- Understanding color in data visualization is crucial. Different color spaces, such as RGB and CMYK, affect how colors are displayed and printed. Choosing the right color palette based on hue, chroma, and luminance can enhance data perception, with three main types of color scales: qualitative, sequential, and diverging.

### Facts
- Color Perception: Color plays a vital role in data interpretation, with various color spaces impacting display and print quality.
- Colorspaces: RGB (Red-Green-Blue) and CMYK (Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-blacK) are commonly used color models in programming and design, respectively.
- Plotting Palette Choice: Selecting the right colors matters. Issues like visibility, similarity, and perception differences can impact data interpretation.
-  HCL Colorspace: Hue-Chroma-Luminance (HCL) addresses color perception issues for effective data visualization.
-  HCL Components: HCL comprises hue (rainbow colors), chroma (intensity), and luminance (brightness).
-  Color Scale Types: Qualitative scales distinguish unordered categories; sequential scales emphasize order, and diverging scales highlight values around a midpoint.
-  alette Examples: Different scales suit different data: qualitative for technology adoption, sequential for ordered categories, and diverging for midpoint emphasis.
- Example Applications: Specific datasets, like survey responses on green technology in Malaysia, illustrate the use of diverging scales for nuanced perceptions.

## Plotting many variables at once | Theory
- Visualizing multiple variables involves using advanced plot types like pair plots, correlation heatmaps, and parallel coordinates plots. These aid in understanding distributions, relationships, and correlations among variables.

### Facts
- Pair plots handle around ten variables, showcasing variable distributions and relationships between each pair.
- LA home prices' pair plot displays four variables, with diagonal panels showing variable distributions.
- Panels off the diagonal in pair plots illustrate relationships between continuous variables via scatter plots and correlations.
- Pair plots compare categorical and continuous variables, showcasing box plots and histograms.
- Pair plots are valuable for swift dataset exploration, while correlation heatmaps simplify visualization for many continuous variables.
- Correlation heatmaps highlight relationships between pairs of continuous variables, enabling easy comparison for numerous variables at once.
- Scatter plots with color representations exhibit three variables together, becoming complex with more variables.
- Parallel coordinates plots aid in understanding relationships or clustering of numerous continuous variables.
- Plotting by continent in parallel coordinates reveals distinct patterns across different regions, providing insights into various metrics for different continents.
