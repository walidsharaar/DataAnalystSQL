## Higher dimensions | Theory
- Understanding higher dimensions beyond the typical two in visualizations involves various techniques like color, size, transparency, shape, and multiple panels, each with its pros and cons.

### Facts
- Visualizing Beyond 2D: Exploring more than two variables in visualizations raises challenges.
- UN Scatter Plots: Life expectancy plotted against schooling length and GNI separately; exploring their combined effect.
- 3D Scatter Plots: Despite being an option, 3D scatter plots lose perspective on a 2D screen, complicating interpretation.
- Beyond x and y: Techniques like color, size, transparency, and shape aid in representing multiple dimensions.
- Color Representation: Color signifies life expectancy, displaying correlations but lacks precise values.
- Size Variation: Points' size represents data, but it can create overlapping issues and visual dominance.
- Transparency Impact: Similar to size, transparency affects focus and precision in data interpretation.
- Shape Differentiation: Using shapes for age ranges in life expectancy, though not ideal due to mental burden.
- Multiple Panels: Dividing data into panels reveals trends across subsets but can complicate interpretation.
- More Panel Precision: Smaller panels offer more precision but also increase visual complexity.
- Line Plot Dimensions: Line plots incorporate aesthetics like color, thickness, transparency, and linetype.
- Color in Line Plots: Color distinguishes lines in technology adoption plots effectively.
- Linetype Usage: Linetype as an alternative dimension in line plots, albeit challenging for distinction.
