## Polar coordinates | Theory
- Plot types like bar plots and histograms have their advantages, but polar coordinates, although they can create pie plots and rose plots, often make data interpretation more challenging. They're rarely the best choice for visualizations except for specific circular data.

### Facts
- Polar coordinates & Pie plots
  -- Polar coordinates can transform bar plots into pie plots by converting bar lengths to angles.
  -- Pie plots, however popular, are harder to interpret than bar plots and can complicate data analysis.
-Famous Athletes Bar Plot
  -- ESPN's famous athletes by sport showcased in a bar plot format.
- Bar Plot + Polar Coordinates = Pie Plot
  -- Converting a bar plot's coordinate system to polar coordinates yields a pie plot.
  -- Pie plots, despite their popularity, are challenging for interpretation compared to bar plots.
- When to Use Polar Coordinates
  -- Polar coordinates are seldom a good choice for visualizations.
  -- They might suit data with inherent circularity (e.g., time of day, directional data).
- Animal Activity Histogram
  -- The histogram of animal activity from the Panama camera trap dataset depicts an issue with the nocturnal paca's activity appearing split due to axis representation.
- Histogram + Polar Coords = Rose Plot
  -- Transforming histograms to polar coordinates creates a rose plot.
  -- Unlike pie plots, in rose plots, it's the x-axis converted to angles while bar heights remain as lengths, aiding in clearer data interpretation, such as the paca's continuous nocturnal activity.

## Axes of evil | Theory
- Issues in data visualization, from misleading axes to misrepresented bar lengths, demonstrate the significance of accurate plotting techniques.

### Facts
- Problems with bar lengths can distort perception, like Yang's 22.5% appearing significantly larger than Sanders' 21%.
- Stacked bar plots with skewed y-axes, like misrepresented phone OS market shares, can mislead about actual data distribution.
- Dual y-axes can create conflicting interpretations; altering the axis changes the perceived correlation between variables.
- Opting for separate panels when plotting different metrics is a clearer and more honest visualization technique.

## Sensory overload | Theory
- This text discusses various aspects of effective data visualization, including measures of good visualization, chartjunk, skeuomorphism, extra dimensions, and the use of ostentatious colors and lines, emphasizing how these elements can affect data interpretation negatively.

### Facts
- Two basic measures of good data visualization are the number of insights a reader can obtain from a plot and how quickly they can grasp those insights.
- Chartjunk refers to elements in a plot that hinder data comprehension, such as unnecessary design additions or elements that distort information.
- Example plots from sources like BBC, Fox News, and Reddit illustrate problems like misrepresenting data through visual elements like images instead of bars, skeuomorphic elements, unnecessary 3D perspectives, and improper use of colors and lines.
- Skeuomorphism, seen in some plots, includes adding real-world elements to virtual objects, which might distract from the actual data.
- The use of unnecessary dimensions, like adding unnecessary 3D perspectives to bar plots, can make data interpretation more challenging without providing additional meaningful information.
- Ostentatious colors and lines, as seen in a plot representing German Federal Council seats, can make visuals unappealing and difficult to comprehend, hindering insights.
