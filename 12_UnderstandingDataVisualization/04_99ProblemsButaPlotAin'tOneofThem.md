## Polar coordinates | Theory
- Plot types like bar plots and histograms have their advantages, but polar coordinates, although they can create pie plots and rose plots, often make data interpretation more challenging. They're rarely the best choice for visualizations except for specific circular data.

### Facts
- Polar coordinates & Pie plots
  -- Polar coordinates can transform bar plots into pie plots by converting bar lengths to angles.
  -- Pie plots, however popular, are harder to interpret than bar plots and can complicate data analysis.
-Famous Athletes Bar Plot
  -- ESPN's famous athletes by sport showcased in a bar plot format.
- Bar Plot + Polar Coordinates = Pie Plot
  -- Converting a bar plot's coordinate system to polar coordinates yields a pie plot.
  -- Pie plots, despite their popularity, are challenging for interpretation compared to bar plots.
- When to Use Polar Coordinates
  -- Polar coordinates are seldom a good choice for visualizations.
  -- They might suit data with inherent circularity (e.g., time of day, directional data).
- Animal Activity Histogram
  -- The histogram of animal activity from the Panama camera trap dataset depicts an issue with the nocturnal paca's activity appearing split due to axis representation.
- Histogram + Polar Coords = Rose Plot
  -- Transforming histograms to polar coordinates creates a rose plot.
  -- Unlike pie plots, in rose plots, it's the x-axis converted to angles while bar heights remain as lengths, aiding in clearer data interpretation, such as the paca's continuous nocturnal activity.
