## Summary Hypothesis testing | Theory

Hypothesis testing involves comparing populations, crucial in various industries, from business to healthcare. It begins with assuming no difference exists, leading to diverse hypotheses and statistical analysis.

### Facts
- Importance of Hypothesis Testing: Essential across industries; used to validate theories like price changes impacting revenue or medication effectiveness in health conditions.
- History: Traces back to the 18th century, seen in early birth record analysis, showing slight gender probability differences.
- Assumption & Null Hypothesis: Starts by assuming no difference between populations (null hypothesis); establishes alternative hypotheses to test differences.
- Workflow: Steps involve selecting populations, forming hypotheses, collecting sample data, conducting statistical tests, and drawing conclusions.
- Sample Size: Larger samples approach population means; referencing peer-reviewed research on similar tests helps determine adequate sample size.
- Variables: Independent variables (like vitamin C intake) are unaffected by other data; dependent variables (e.g., gender birth ratio) are influenced by other values. They're crucial in analysis and visualization.

## Summary Experiments | Theory

Experiments within hypothesis testing involve treatment and control groups to assess the impact of certain factors. They utilize various methodologies like randomized controlled trials to minimize bias and draw accurate conclusions.

### Facts
- Experiments are a subset of hypothesis testing focusing on sample data to infer about a larger population, used both in research and industry for product enhancements.
- Treatment and control groups in experiments aim to measure the effect of a treatment (independent variable) on a response (dependent variable).
- An example involves using an advertisement as a treatment to observe its impact on product purchases, often visualized through bar plots.
- Controlled experiments randomly assign participants to treatment and control groups to minimize bias, ensuring comparability between groups.
- The gold standard in experiments involves randomization and blinding methods to reduce bias, ensuring more reliable conclusions.
- Double-blind randomized controlled trials prevent bias in both administering the treatment and analyzing the results.
- Randomized controlled trials, akin to A/B testing in industries, test multiple treatments or variations with the aim of comparing their effects.
