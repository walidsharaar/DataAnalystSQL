## Summary Hypothesis testing | Theory

Hypothesis testing involves comparing populations, crucial in various industries, from business to healthcare. It begins with assuming no difference exists, leading to diverse hypotheses and statistical analysis.

### Facts
- Importance of Hypothesis Testing: Essential across industries; used to validate theories like price changes impacting revenue or medication effectiveness in health conditions.
- History: Traces back to the 18th century, seen in early birth record analysis, showing slight gender probability differences.
- Assumption & Null Hypothesis: Starts by assuming no difference between populations (null hypothesis); establishes alternative hypotheses to test differences.
- Workflow: Steps involve selecting populations, forming hypotheses, collecting sample data, conducting statistical tests, and drawing conclusions.
- Sample Size: Larger samples approach population means; referencing peer-reviewed research on similar tests helps determine adequate sample size.
- Variables: Independent variables (like vitamin C intake) are unaffected by other data; dependent variables (e.g., gender birth ratio) are influenced by other values. They're crucial in analysis and visualization.
