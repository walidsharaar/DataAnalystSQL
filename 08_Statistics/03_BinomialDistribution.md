## Summary The binomial distribution | Theory

- The binomial distribution models probabilities of success in a sequence of independent events, like coin flips.
- Coin flips showcase binary outcomes with equal probabilities for each event.
- It's a discrete distribution with parameters: n (number of events) and p (probability of success).
- The distribution graph for 10 coin flips peaks at five heads, with smaller chances for extremes like zero or ten heads.
- To find probabilities, add individual outcomes, like the chance of getting seven or fewer heads in 10 flips (94.5%).
- Conversely, the probability of eight or more heads is obtained by subtracting from 100% (5.5%).
- Expected value is found by multiplying n by p; for 10 flips, it's 5 heads. p can be derived if n and expected value are known.
- Independence is crucial; events must not affect each other for the binomial distribution to apply.
- Sampling without replacement alters probabilities between events, invalidating the binomial distribution's accuracy.
- It's useful in diverse scenarios: clinical trials, sports bettingâ€”where binary outcomes occur independently.
