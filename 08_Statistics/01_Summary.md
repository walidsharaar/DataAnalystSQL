## What is statistics? | Theory
- Statistics Overview: Statistics is the study of collecting and analyzing data with two main branches: descriptive (summarizing data) and inferential (drawing conclusions from samples).
- Ubiquity of Statistics: Statistics permeates daily life, from sports stats to personal finance tracking.
- Functions of Statistics: Answers practical questions, shapes societal improvements, validates scientific breakthroughs.
- Limitations of Statistics: Not suitable for explaining causation or answering broad, open-ended questions.
- Numeric Data Types
  - Numeric data includes continuous (e.g., stock prices)
  - interval/count data (e.g., cups of coffee consumed).
- Visualizing Numeric Data: Utilizing scatter plots to visualize relationships between numeric data points.
- Categorical Data Types
  - Categorical data consists of nominal (unordered categories like eye color)
  - Ordinal (ordered categories like survey responses) types.
- Visualizing Categorical Data: Grouping categorical data for comparison, such as displaying crime rates in different London boroughs.
- Descriptive/Summary Statistics: Summarizing data to describe specifics, like the percentage of thefts in Westminster compared to other boroughs.
- Inferential Statistics: Using a sample to infer conclusions about a larger population, like predicting clothing purchases due to social media advertising based on a survey.


## Measures of Center : Discussion on summary statistics starting with measures of center.

- Usefulness of Measures of Center: Illustrating practical applications in everyday scenarios like average sales orders, typical costs, and common characteristics.
- Crime Data Overview: Introduction to the crime dataset focusing on London Boroughs and their crime counts over two years.
- Burglaries in Barnet: Noting a specific count of burglaries in the London Borough of Barnet: 5067 incidents.
- Histograms for Data Visualization: Explanation of histograms as a visual tool to segment data into ranges; showcased a histogram of vehicle offenses in London.
- Typical Vehicle Crime in London: Highlighting the challenge of determining typical values through visualization methods like histograms.
- Measures of Center: Mean
  - Definition and calculation of the mean as a method to describe the central tendency of data.
- Mean Values for Crime Types: Showcasing mean values for different crime types, with theft having the largest mean.
- Measures of Center: Median
  - Introduction and explanation of the median as another measure of central tendency.
  - Median Calculation with Even Values
    - Strategy for determining the median with an even number of values.
- Comparison: Mean vs. Median
  - Comparison between mean and median values, showing the slight difference for burglaries.
- Measures of Center: Mode
  - Introducing the mode as the most frequent value and its relevance in categorical data.
- Choosing the Right Measure
  - Considering data symmetry to decide between mean and median; showcasing their applicability based on data distribution.
- Data Symmetry Impact
  - Explaining how outliers affect mean and median calculations, suggesting the use of median for non-symmetrical data.
