## Understanding Chance:
  - People often discuss chance regarding various outcomes, such as closing a sale, predicting rain, or winning a game.
  - Estimating chances accurately is valuable across different life areas.

- Measuring Chance with Probability:
  - Probability calculation involves determining an event's probability by dividing ways an event can occur by total possible outcomes.
  - Probability ranges between 0% (impossible) and 100% (certain to happen).

- Assigning Salespeople:
  - Selecting a sales team member randomly for a meeting is a form of sampling from a pool of names.
  - Probability dictates the likelihood of selecting a specific person, like Brian, for a meeting.

- Morning & Afternoon Meetings:
  - Random selection for meetings at different times maintains consistent individual probabilities.
  - Sampling with replacement allows the same person to be chosen again.

- Independent Probability:
  - Demonstrates that an event's probability remains unchanged by previous outcomes.

- Analyzing Online Retail Sales:
  - Previewing an online retail dataset to understand order details like product type, quantity, sales, discounts, returns, and net sales.

- Probability of Jewelry Product Orders:
  - Calculating the probability of the next order being a jewelry product by dividing the number of jewelry product orders by the total orders.

- Probabilities for Different Product Types:
  - Repeating the probability calculation process for all popular product types to determine the chances of receiving orders for each type.

## Conditional probability
- When one event affects the outcome of another, that's where conditional probability comes in.
- Dependent events
  - Picking without replacement changes probabilities for subsequent picks.
  - The outcome of one pick influences the probability of the next.
- Sampling without replacement
  - Claire's selection showcases dependent events: 33% chance if not picked first, 0% if picked first.
  - Each selection in this scenario relies on the prior pick.

- Understanding conditional probability
  - It's about calculating probabilities of dependent events based on each other's outcomes.
  - Real-life examples abound, like predicting train delays based on previous delays or a movie's success linked to the director's accolades.

- Visualizing with Venn diagrams
 - Venn diagrams illustrate how dependent events impact each other's probabilities.
 - They display the overlap between events and how it changes with different outcomes.

- Applying conditional probability
  - Applying it to sales data: Calculating the likelihood of orders over $150 specifically for kitchen products.
  - The formula: (Orders meeting both conditions) / (Total kitchen orders) = 12.4%.

- Order matters in conditional probability
  - Switching the order of events changes the calculated conditional probability.
  - This highlights the impact of event sequence on the probability outcome.
- Formula for conditional probability
  - The formula for conditional probability: P(A|B) = P(A âˆ© B) / P(B).
