## Understanding Chance:
  - People often discuss chance regarding various outcomes, such as closing a sale, predicting rain, or winning a game.
  - Estimating chances accurately is valuable across different life areas.

- Measuring Chance with Probability:
  - Probability calculation involves determining an event's probability by dividing ways an event can occur by total possible outcomes.
  - Probability ranges between 0% (impossible) and 100% (certain to happen).

- Assigning Salespeople:
  - Selecting a sales team member randomly for a meeting is a form of sampling from a pool of names.
  - Probability dictates the likelihood of selecting a specific person, like Brian, for a meeting.

- Morning & Afternoon Meetings:
  - Random selection for meetings at different times maintains consistent individual probabilities.
  - Sampling with replacement allows the same person to be chosen again.

- Independent Probability:
  - Demonstrates that an event's probability remains unchanged by previous outcomes.

- Analyzing Online Retail Sales:
  - Previewing an online retail dataset to understand order details like product type, quantity, sales, discounts, returns, and net sales.

- Probability of Jewelry Product Orders:

- Probabilities for Different Product Types:
