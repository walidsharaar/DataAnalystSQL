## Understanding Chance:
  - People often discuss chance regarding various outcomes, such as closing a sale, predicting rain, or winning a game.
  - Estimating chances accurately is valuable across different life areas.

- Measuring Chance with Probability:
  - Probability calculation involves determining an event's probability by dividing ways an event can occur by total possible outcomes.
  - Probability ranges between 0% (impossible) and 100% (certain to happen).

- Assigning Salespeople:
  - Selecting a sales team member randomly for a meeting is a form of sampling from a pool of names.
  - Probability dictates the likelihood of selecting a specific person, like Brian, for a meeting.

- Morning & Afternoon Meetings:
  - Random selection for meetings at different times maintains consistent individual probabilities.
  - Sampling with replacement allows the same person to be chosen again.

- Independent Probability:
  - Demonstrates that an event's probability remains unchanged by previous outcomes.

- Analyzing Online Retail Sales:
  - Previewing an online retail dataset to understand order details like product type, quantity, sales, discounts, returns, and net sales.

- Probability of Jewelry Product Orders:
  - Calculating the probability of the next order being a jewelry product by dividing the number of jewelry product orders by the total orders.

- Probabilities for Different Product Types:
  - Repeating the probability calculation process for all popular product types to determine the chances of receiving orders for each type.

## Conditional probability
- When one event affects the outcome of another, that's where conditional probability comes in.
- Dependent events
  - Picking without replacement changes probabilities for subsequent picks.
  - The outcome of one pick influences the probability of the next.
- Sampling without replacement
  - Claire's selection showcases dependent events: 33% chance if not picked first, 0% if picked first.
  - Each selection in this scenario relies on the prior pick.

- Understanding conditional probability
  - It's about calculating probabilities of dependent events based on each other's outcomes.
  - Real-life examples abound, like predicting train delays based on previous delays or a movie's success linked to the director's accolades.

- Visualizing with Venn diagrams
 - Venn diagrams illustrate how dependent events impact each other's probabilities.
 - They display the overlap between events and how it changes with different outcomes.

- Applying conditional probability
  - Applying it to sales data: Calculating the likelihood of orders over $150 specifically for kitchen products.
  - The formula: (Orders meeting both conditions) / (Total kitchen orders) = 12.4%.

- Order matters in conditional probability
  - Switching the order of events changes the calculated conditional probability.
  - This highlights the impact of event sequence on the probability outcome.
- Formula for conditional probability
  - The formula for conditional probability: P(A|B) = P(A âˆ© B) / P(B).

## Discrete distributions | Theory
- Discrete Distributions
  - Rolling the Dice
    - Six-sided die with equal chances for each outcome.
- Choosing Salespeople
  - Similarity between die outcomes and selecting names.
- Probability Distribution Basics
  - Describing possible outcomes' probabilities.
  - Calculating expected values using probabilities.
- Importance of Probability Distributions
  - Quantifying risk and aiding decision-making.
  - Used in hypothesis testing for result analysis.
- Visualizing Probability Distributions
  - Histograms depict outcomes and their probabilities.
- Calculating Probabilities as Areas
  - Probability equated to areas in distributions.
  - Example: Probability of specific outcomes on a die.
- Uneven Die Probabilities
  - Altering probabilities affects the expected value.
- Visualizing Uneven Probabilities
  - Changed probabilities alter distribution visualization.
- Discrete Probability Distributions
  - Representing count or interval data.
  - Discrete outcomes with equal probabilities.
- Sampling from Discrete Distributions
  - Relating sampling from a distribution to dice rolls.
  - Sampling with replacement and expected values.
- Visualizing Sample Outcomes
  - Histograms display outcomes from multiple rolls.
- Sample Distribution vs Theoretical Distribution
  - Variations in sample outcomes despite equal probabilities.
  - Comparison of sample mean to theoretical mean.
- Effect of Sample Size
  - Larger samples converge closer to theoretical distributions.
  - Law of Large Numbers: Sample mean approaches theoretical mean with larger samples.

## Continuous distributions model continuous data, unlike discrete distributions which handle count or interval data.
- Waiting for a bus exemplifies continuous uniform distribution, with a probability line representing wait times from zero to 12 minutes.
- Probability equates to area in continuous distributions, calculated by the width times the height of a rectangle representing the probability.
- Calculating probabilities within certain time frames involves finding the area under the probability line.
- Probability of waiting more than a specified time is obtained by subtracting the probability of waiting less from the total probability.
- Distributions aren't solely uniform; bimodal distributions show two peak values occurring more frequently.
- The normal distribution, a bell-shaped curve, is a common continuous distribution seen in various scenarios like blood pressure or retirement age.
- Regardless of the distribution shape, the total area under the curve always equals one, covering 100% of possible outcomes.
