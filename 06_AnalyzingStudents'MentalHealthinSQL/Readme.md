<!-- 
Explore and analyze the students data to see how the study reached its conclusions and gain a better understanding of it. This project will take you through some exploratory analysis before investigating a specific factor for international students. The final query is the only part of your code that will be tested.
Your project will follow these exploratory steps:
1. Start by counting all of the records in the data, then all records per student type to see how the records are categorized and scored.
2. Filter the data to see how it differs between the student types.
3. Find the summary statistics of the diagnostic tests for all students using aggregate functions, rounding the test scores to two decimal places, remembering to use aliases.
4. Repeat this to summarize the data for international students only.
Your final query:
See if length of stay impacts the average diagnostic scores rounded to two decimal places for international students, and order the results by descending order of the length of stay.
The final output of your query with aliases will have a total nine observation rows and four columns: stay, average_phq, average_scs, and average_as, in that order.
