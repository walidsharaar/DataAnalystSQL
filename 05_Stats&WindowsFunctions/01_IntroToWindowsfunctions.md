## Summary Introduction | SQL
This course, led by Michel Semaan and Fernando Gonzalez Prada, introduces window functions, simplifying complex SQL queries, and their application in analyzing the Summer Olympics dataset.

### Facts
- Motivation: Window functions eliminate the need for convoluted SQL queries by performing operations across related rows, allowing tasks like calculating running totals and fetching previous row values efficiently.
- Course Outline: Divided into four chapters, covering window function fundamentals, fetching/ranking values, using aggregate functions, and advanced techniques when combined with window functions.
- Summer Olympics Dataset: The dataset used throughout the course represents awarded medals, encompassing year, city, sport, athlete details, and medal types.
- Window Functions: They operate across rows while maintaining the entire row output, enabling tasks like fetching values from preceding or succeeding rows, assigning ranks, and calculating running totals/moving averages.
- Row Numbers: Fundamental in window functions, they assign indices to rows, allowing referencing based on position, independent of values.
- ROW_NUMBER: An example of a window function, assigns a sequential number to each row based on the specified window frame.
- Anatomy of a Window Function: The OVER clause in window functions can include subclauses like ORDER BY, PARTITION BY, and ROWS/FOLLOWING, impacting the function's output significantly. Understanding these subclauses is crucial for nuanced application.

This course provides a comprehensive understanding of window functions in SQL, offering efficient solutions for data analysis tasks within the context of the Summer Olympics dataset.
