## Introduction to Full-Text Search: Explores PostgreSQL's built-in functions for data transformation in SQL.
- Topics:
  - Advanced PostgreSQL features: Custom code extensions, full-text search capabilities, improving search with extensions, and advanced combined capabilities.
- The LIKE Operator:
  - Uses wildcards in a WHERE clause for pattern matching.
  - Underscore matches one character, percent matches zero or more characters.
  - Example: Using percent wildcard to find titles starting with "ELF."
  - Alters percent wildcard position for different search results.
  - Matches specific characters in a string but is case sensitive.
- LIKE vs. Full-Text Search:
  - Demonstrates full-text search using to_tsvector and to_tsquery functions, which accommodate variations and are case insensitive.
- What is Full-Text Search?:
  - Provides natural language queries, stemming, fuzzy string matching, and result ranking by similarity.
- Full-Text Search Syntax Explained:
  - Utilizes to_tsvector and to_tsquery functions to convert text to tsvector data, enabling powerful basic search queries.
