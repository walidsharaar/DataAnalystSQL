## Summary Types of reports | Theory
### Types of Reports:
- Informational reports: Brief, factual, no strict structure, aim to inform without analysis.
- Analytical reports: Provide analysis, have a strict structure, drive decisions based on data.
- Presentation Strategy: Structuring written reports: Understanding report types, achieving reproducibility, writing clear reports.
- Written Reports: Communication's scenario: Sentiment analysis on product reviews, focusing on delayed shippings & model accuracy.
- Industry standards: Validating results, ensuring recommendations drive expected change.
- Report Structures:
  - Introduction: Summarize report purpose, contextual information, analysis questions.
  - Body Sections: Data description, methods, analysis, results with visuals.
  - Conclusion: Restate analysis, summarize key results, provide recommendations.
- Tailoring for Audiences:
     - Adapt to stakeholders: Tailor reports for different audience interests.
     - Executive team focus: Introduction, conclusion, key recommendations.
     - Technical stakeholders: Concentrate on the technical body of the report for validation.

Summary
ðŸ“š Understanding Report Structure:

### Importance of structuring reports effectively for clarity and comprehension.
- Written Reports & Communication: Vital role in conveying findings clearly and ensuring reproducibility.
- Reproducibility Example: Analogous to following a friend's recipe precisely to bake a cake - trust in obtaining the same results. Similarly, in data projects, rerunning code should yield identical results.
- Replicability Example:Cooking the same cake with a different set of tools and ingredients. In data, obtaining similar outcomes through different setups (languages, OS) while processing data similarly.
- Virtues of Reproducibility & Replicability: Preventing duplicated efforts, fostering building upon existing work, enabling peer review, emphasizing reproducibility regardless of tools used.
- Best Practices: Documenting scripts, listing used packages, employing version control, and avoiding manual data manipulation for clarity and adaptability.
- Best Practices Continued: Saving dataset versions, tracking data transformations narratively, and versioning changes to ease troubleshooting and revisions.
- Ensuring Model Consistency: Setting random seeds in machine learning algorithms to control randomness and enhance reproducibility.
- Interpretability for Stakeholders: Explaining findings with compelling narratives aids stakeholder understanding and allows for reproducibility of conclusions.
- Citing Sources: Essential to correctly cite and reference others' work in analysis.
- References & Citations: Importance of citations, styles like APA, and reference management tools for efficient tracking and retrieval of information.
