## Summary Selecting the right data | Theory
Understanding data storytelling involves selecting the right data, tailoring presentations to different audiences, and addressing skepticism with appropriate evidence.

### Facts
- Data storytelling fundamentals are crucial for effective communication.
- Preparation involves identifying personas and choosing suitable findings, statistics, and formats.
- Designing a story includes deciding between technical and non-technical approaches.
- Selecting the right data means providing contextual insights to support the main point without overwhelming the report.
- Data quality impacts the analysis and presentation of findings.
- Tailoring presentations for various stakeholders involves understanding their interests and technical knowledge.
- Identifying audience personas helps in conveying key insights effectively.
- Different stakeholders, like the executive team, project manager, tech team, and general audience, require specific types of information tailored to their interests and technical expertise.
- Audience skepticism might require additional evidence and information to convince skeptics of the presented results.

## Summary Showing relevant statistics | Theory
Understanding various data metrics crucial for effective storytelling and analysis, including absolute vs. relative changes, ratios, aggregates like mean and median, and the significance of p-values.

### Facts
- Identifying audience profiles is key in data analysis.
- Specific metrics aid in conveying diverse messages in data storytelling.
- Absolute vs. relative changes: Choosing the right metric depends on the context and question at hand.
- Exploring proportion changes through percentage shifts is essential for accurate representation.
- Ratios help normalize data for comparison across different scales.
- Aggregates like totals, means, and medians provide overall or representative values but may have limitations based on data distribution.
- Mean vs. median: Median can be more robust, especially in cases of non-normally distributed data or outliers.
- Understanding p-values for statistical significance: A value below 0.05 conventionally signifies significance but does not prove absolute truth and may require additional supporting metrics for clarity.

## Summary Visualizations for different audiences | Theory
- Visualizations in storytelling:Crafting visualizations to suit diverse audiences.
- Tailoring communication: Choosing visualizations for technical and non-technical audiences.
- Data storytelling essentials: Selecting, adjusting visualizations based on audience expertise.
- Targeted messaging: Customizing visuals for different recipients (investor vs. technical lead).
- Visualization-message alignment: Linking data elements directly to convey specific messages.
- Providing contextual insights: Incorporating context in visualizations to support messages.
- Best practices: Applying the Pareto principle, simplifying visuals for engagement.
- McCandless method: Steps for effective visualization presentation (headline, anticipation of questions, insight clarification, relatability).
- Practical application: Engaging in practice to reinforce these visualization concepts.

## Summary Choosing the appropriate format | Theory
- Choosing the appropriate format: Learning when to use various presentation formats.
- Data storytelling road: Final piece in the communication strategy. Designed, defined approach, selected data, impactful visualization, ready for presentation.
- Which format is more effective?
-- Engaging, understandable communication.
  Discussing written reports vs. oral presentations.
- Presentation strategy:
- Considerations: audience, content, special requirements, and channels.
- Stakeholders: Understanding the audience's needs and purposes for the findings.
- Content: Deciding what to include based on audience needs: results, conclusions, recommendations, methodology explanation.
- Requirements: Identifying special stakeholder needs: time availability, reporting requirements, time zones.
- Consumption: Formats like Word docs, Jupyter notebooks, articles, slide decks.
- Delivery methods: direct presentation, email, Slack.
- Audience size considerations.
- Oral communication:
--  Strengths: relationship building, immediate feedback, body language richness.
--  Weaknesses: lack of revision, not suitable for lengthy messages.
- Written communication:
-- Strengths: record keeping, shareability, less emotional reactions, suitable for technical details.
-- Weaknesses: lack of immediate feedback, harder to adapt without real-time reactions.
- Appropriate format: Example scenario: CEO's interest in conclusions, preferring a quick oral presentation during her visit. Subsequent need for a structured written report based on her feedback for investor decisions.
