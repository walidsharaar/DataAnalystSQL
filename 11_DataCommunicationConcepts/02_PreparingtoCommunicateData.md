## Summary Selecting the right data | Theory
Understanding data storytelling involves selecting the right data, tailoring presentations to different audiences, and addressing skepticism with appropriate evidence.

### Facts
- Data storytelling fundamentals are crucial for effective communication.
- Preparation involves identifying personas and choosing suitable findings, statistics, and formats.
- Designing a story includes deciding between technical and non-technical approaches.
- Selecting the right data means providing contextual insights to support the main point without overwhelming the report.
- Data quality impacts the analysis and presentation of findings.
- Tailoring presentations for various stakeholders involves understanding their interests and technical knowledge.
- Identifying audience personas helps in conveying key insights effectively.
- Different stakeholders, like the executive team, project manager, tech team, and general audience, require specific types of information tailored to their interests and technical expertise.
- Audience skepticism might require additional evidence and information to convince skeptics of the presented results.

## Summary Showing relevant statistics | Theory
Understanding various data metrics crucial for effective storytelling and analysis, including absolute vs. relative changes, ratios, aggregates like mean and median, and the significance of p-values.

### Facts
- Identifying audience profiles is key in data analysis.
- Specific metrics aid in conveying diverse messages in data storytelling.
- Absolute vs. relative changes: Choosing the right metric depends on the context and question at hand.
- Exploring proportion changes through percentage shifts is essential for accurate representation.
- Ratios help normalize data for comparison across different scales.
- Aggregates like totals, means, and medians provide overall or representative values but may have limitations based on data distribution.
- Mean vs. median: Median can be more robust, especially in cases of non-normally distributed data or outliers.
- Understanding p-values for statistical significance: A value below 0.05 conventionally signifies significance but does not prove absolute truth and may require additional supporting metrics for clarity.
