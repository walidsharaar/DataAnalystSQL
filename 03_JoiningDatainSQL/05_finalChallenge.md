  Your task is to determine the top 10 capital cities in Europe and the Americas by city_perc, a metric you'll calculate. city_perc is a percentage that calculates the "proper" population in a city as a percentage of the total population in the wider metro area, as follows:
city_proper_pop / metroarea_pop * 100
Do not use table aliasing in this exercise
</p>
<P>
From cities, select the city name, country code, proper population, and metro area population, as well as the field city_perc, which calculates the proper population as a percentage of metro area population for each city (using the formula provided).
Filter city name with a subquery that selects capital cities from countries in 'Europe' or continents with 'America' at the end of their name.
Exclude NULL values in metroarea_pop.
Order by city_perc (descending) and return only the first 10 rows.
</P>
```
-- Select fields from cities
SELECT 
	name, 
    country_code, 
    city_proper_pop, 
    metroarea_pop,
    city_proper_pop / metroarea_pop * 100 AS city_perc
FROM cities
-- Use subquery to filter city name
WHERE name IN
  (SELECT capital
   FROM countries
   WHERE (continent = 'Europe'
   OR continent LIKE '%America'))
-- Add filter condition such that metroarea_pop does not have null values
	  AND metroarea_pop IS NOT NULL
-- Sort and limit the result
ORDER BY city_perc DESC
LIMIT 10;
