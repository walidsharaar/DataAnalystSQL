## Summary Set theory for SQL Joins | SQL
Set theory introduces set operations like UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT in SQL, enabling combining and comparing data from tables without explicit join conditions.

### Facts
- Set operations in SQL are akin to Venn diagrams, with UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT mirroring their concepts.

*Venn diagrams*
- UNION combines records from two tables, discarding duplicates, yielding a single set of distinct records.

*Union diagrams*

- UNION ALL functions similarly to UNION but retains duplicates, resulting in a combined set with all records, including duplicates.

*Union all diagrams*
- Syntax for set operations involves SELECT statements for tables and the set operation (UNION/UNION ALL) between them, requiring identical column count and data types.

*Union & Union all Syntax*
<br/>Understanding these set operations in SQL extends the toolkit for combining data without the need for explicit join conditions, focusing on set theory principles and data stacking rather than table merging.
