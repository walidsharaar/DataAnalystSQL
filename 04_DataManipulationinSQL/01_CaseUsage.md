## Summary We'll take the CASE | SQL
Intermediate SQL, focusing on shaping and manipulating data using CASE statements, subqueries, and window functions within the context of the European Soccer Database.

### Facts
- Intermediate SQL provides skills to access and shape robust datasets in relational databases.
- Covered topics include CASE statements, subqueries, and window functions for data transformation.
- Prerequisites involve familiarity with basic SQL concepts like joins, arithmetic functions, and filtering with WHERE clauses.
- The course employs the European Soccer Database with tables for matches, teams, leagues, and countries.
- Analyzing wins, losses, and ties for the 2013/2014 season involves using the "Match" table's home_goal and away_goal columns.
- CASE statements act as SQL's conditional statements, allowing for conditional data manipulation within queries.
- Example: Creating new variables to categorize match outcomes (home team wins, away team wins, or ties) using CASE statements.
- Practice in upcoming lessons involves structuring CASE statements with arithmetic functions (COUNT, SUM, AVERAGE) to categorize data.
